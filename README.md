# ART Class
## _Made by a group for EKA Univeristy._ <br />


### What do you do?

You're a teacher in an unknown school, doing the bare minimum to keep your job. You must grade artworks depending on the requirements & earn a bunch of money before the school finds out you are lazy and fires you.


### How do you do?

Artworks get subbmited at random intervals, you must approve or dissaprove with your very own stamping tools,   depending on the requiraments stated in your trusty guidebook.


### How much money can you get, before you get fired?
